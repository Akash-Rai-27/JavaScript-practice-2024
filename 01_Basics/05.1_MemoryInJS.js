/* 

 ?       --> Stack (primitive) --> you get the copy of variable if its defined in stack
* JS ---
  ?      --> Heap (non-primitive) --> you get the reference of the original object/value which is defined in the stack


  ! if we make changes in the reference the original value is also changed --> heap

  ! in stack , we pass a copy of the value so it does not change, the original remains the same
